        <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/FmyemlqkeTXT4hWaKqePy0PbWCbQjV-H8lQfteBvkmU/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFn/ZXM0LmFscGhhY29k/ZXJzLmNvbS8xMzAv/dGh1bWJiaWctMTMw/MDY5OC53ZWJw" alt="restaurent" height="250px" width="530px">
        <p>Izuku Midoriya, born without superpowers (quirks) in a world where they are the norm, is the main protagonist of the anime and manga series My Hero Academia.
          Despite being initially powerless, he showed an unyielding spirit and a strong sense of justice, dreaming of becoming the world’s greatest hero like his idol, All Might.
          His life changed when All Might chose him as his successor, granting him the powerful quirk One For All. With this ability, Midoriya embarked on a journey of intense training and self-discovery at U.A. High School, where young heroes are trained.
          Throughout his journey, he faced formidable villains, life-threatening battles, and moments of self-doubt, yet his determination, compassion, and courage inspired his peers and even rivals.
          Izuku Midoriya continues to grow into a symbol of hope, proving that true heroism is not defined by power alone, but by the will to protect others at any cost.</p>

        <p>Shoto Todoroki, born on January 11, is one of the main characters in the anime and manga series My Hero Academia.
        He is the son of Endeavor, the No. 2 Pro Hero, and was raised under strict and harsh training to become the perfect hero. Shoto possesses a unique dual quirk, Half-Cold Half-Hot, which grants him the power to generate ice from his right side and fire from his left, making him one of the most versatile students at U.A. High School.
        Initially, he rejected using his fire abilities due to resentment toward his father’s abusive methods, relying only on his ice. However, through his encounters with Izuku Midoriya and his classmates, Shoto gradually accepted both sides of his quirk, learning to forge his own identity as a hero rather than living under his father’s shadow.
        Despite his internal struggles and family conflicts, Shoto continues to grow as a determined and compassionate hero-in-training. His calm demeanor, immense power, and drive for justice make him one of the strongest and most respected young heroes of his generation.</p>

        <p>Katsuki Bakugo, born on April 20, is one of the main characters in the anime and manga series My Hero Academia.
          From a young age, he displayed a powerful quirk called Explosion, which allows him to create blasts from the nitroglycerin-like sweat on his palms. Confident and hot-headed, Bakugo was often seen as aggressive and competitive, especially toward his childhood friend Izuku Midoriya.
          Despite his brash personality, Bakugo possesses exceptional intelligence, combat skills, and determination, making him one of the top students at U.A. High School. His dream is to surpass all heroes, including All Might, and become the No. 1 Hero through sheer strength and willpower.
          Over time, Bakugo’s character developed beyond his pride and anger. He learned the importance of teamwork, responsibility, and protecting others, while still keeping his fiery determination.
          Today, Katsuki Bakugo stands as one of the strongest young heroes in training, admired for his raw power, sharp instincts, and unshakable drive to win.</p>
